              So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was
              terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers
              a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention
              or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment,
              I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
